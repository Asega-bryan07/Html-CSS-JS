# FIX_MY_PHP: 
    This is a continuation of the web development project. Now we have moved from the front-end; much of a designer,
    to the backend, where we are becoming developers from designers.
    '''
# in this project, you are required to do the following:
        * create a database that will intergrate with the PHP files published.
        * create a table that will store the data from the PHP files.
        * link the PHP files accordingly
        * fix basic PHP syntaxes thet have been mismtched in the files.
        * give a screenshot of your login page and register pages.
        * this is a preparation for PHP CRUD that will come in later next week.
    # Cheers!
